Hi, This is Malay Pal and I am an interdisciplinary scientist.
I completed PhD in BioNanoTechnology from Indian Institute of Science (IISc), India. My PhD dissertation includes the studies of Micro/Nanomachines and their dynamics for application in cellular biophysics. I have expertise in nanofabrication and characterization techniques, microfluidics, bioengineering and algorithm development. I hold two Master's degrees: MS(Engineering) from IISc and MSc(Physics) from Visva Bharati University. Currently, I am working as Research Enginner in a India-Based BioTech company. I develop microfluidics platform and AI for digital pathology. 

- ðŸ‘€ Iâ€™m interested in many cutting-edge topics which indclude Machine Leanring, Deep Learning, Medical Imaging, Semiconductor Metrology, BioNanoTechnology, Microscopy, Digital Patholohy. 
- ðŸ‘€ Iâ€™m currently learning cloud based ML. 
- ðŸ‘€ Iâ€™m looking to collaborate on ML based projects. 
- ðŸ‘€ You can find me at malaypal.physics@yahoo.in
